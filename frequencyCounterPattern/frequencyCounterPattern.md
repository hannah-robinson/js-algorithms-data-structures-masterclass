# Frequency Counters

- Pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
- Can often avoid need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays/strings
- Comparing 2 or more inputs, checking anagrams, is value contained inside another value
- Avoid nested loops, 2 (unnested) loops is way better than a nested loop (quadratic O(n))
